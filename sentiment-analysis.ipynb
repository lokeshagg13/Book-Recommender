    "Because it was fine-tuned on a labeled dataset, there are evaluation metrics available that give us insights into its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- According to information from **[Dataloop.ai/j-hartmann-eedb](https://dataloop.ai/library/model/j-hartmann_emotion-english-distilroberta-base/)**, the model achieved an **evaluation accuracy of approximately 66%** on its validation set.\n",
    "- While 66% might seem modest at first, it's important to compare this against the **random chance baseline**:\n",
    "  - Since the model predicts across **7 categories** (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral), random guessing would yield an expected accuracy of about **14%**.\n",
    "  - Thus, 66% is **significantly higher** than random, showing the model has **learned meaningful patterns** from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Why This Model is Suitable:\n",
    "- It has **learned rich semantic relationships** from the training data.\n",
    "- **Pre-trained** and **fine-tuned** carefully, saving us the heavy cost and time of building a custom model.\n",
    "- Provides **reliable emotion predictions** to enrich our recommender system with emotional tone filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can **trust** this model and proceed to use it for measuring the emotional content in our **book descriptions**."

    "\n",
    "Now that we have a working sentiment classifier capable of predicting emotions in text, the next step is **deciding how to apply it** to our book descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two options for applying sentiment analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Whole Description Level**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predict the **overall** emotion for the **entire** book description as a single block of text.\n",
    "- **Pros**: Simpler, faster, less computationally expensive.\n",
    "- **Cons**: Might **miss out** on nuances if the description contains **multiple emotions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Sentence-by-Sentence Level**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Break down** each description into **individual sentences**.\n",
    "- Predict the **emotion for each sentence** separately.\n",
    "- **Pros**: Captures the **varied emotional tones** across different parts of the description.\n",
    "- **Cons**: Slightly **more complex** and **slower**, as it processes more inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Example Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a sample book description:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"A novel that readers and critics have been eagerly anticipating for over a decade, *Gilead* is an astonishingly imagined story of remarkable lives.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- This first sentence feels **surprising** and **joyful**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Haunted by his grandfather's presence, John tells of the rift between his grandfather and his father, the elder, an angry visionary who fought for the abolitionist cause, and his son, an ardent pacifist.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- This second sentence carries feelings of **fear**, **anger**, and **sadness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### If we only run sentiment analysis on the entire description, we might **lose important emotional details** embedded within different sentences.  Thus, **sentence-level sentiment analysis** could give us **richer and more accurate emotional profiles** of the books, enabling better filtering and recommendation features for users!```"

    "\n",
    "When performing **sentence-level sentiment analysis**, a complication arises:  \n",
    "**Multiple emotions** can now be associated with the **same book description**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a **strategy** to **summarize** these multiple emotions into a usable format for our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Proposed Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each book description:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a **separate column** for each of the **seven emotion categories**:\n",
    "  - `anger`, `disgust`, `fear`, `joy`, `sadness`, `surprise`, and `neutral`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- For each emotion:\n",
    "  - **Take the maximum probability** score across **all sentences**.\n",
    "  - This ensures that **even if only one part** of the description strongly expresses an emotion, it is **captured**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sentence | Joy | Sadness | Fear | ... |\n",
    "|:--------|:---:|:-------:|:----:|:---:|\n",
    "| Sentence 1 | 0.12 | 0.05 | 0.02 | ... |\n",
    "| Sentence 2 | 0.85 | 0.10 | 0.03 | ... |\n",
    "| Sentence 3 | 0.30 | 0.50 | 0.20 | ... |\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Joy**: `0.85` (highest across sentences)\n",
    "- **Sadness**: `0.50`\n",
    "- **Fear**: `0.20`\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the book's final emotional profile will reflect the **strongest emotional signals** detected anywhere in its description."
