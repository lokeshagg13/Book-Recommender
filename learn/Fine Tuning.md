# ‚ö° Fine-Tuning a BERT Model for Emotion Classification

Fine-tuning a **pre-trained BERT model** on a **small labeled emotion dataset**.

## How Fine-Tuning Works:

- BERT is a **transformer-based encoder** model pre-trained on massive text corpora like Wikipedia and books.
- BERT‚Äôs **encoder layers** capture deep, rich semantic information about language.
- During fine-tuning:
  - We **keep** the pre-trained **encoder layers** (they are **not reset**).
  - We **replace the final output layers** (originally for masked language modeling) with **new layers** for emotion classification.
  - Using a labeled dataset (text + emotion labels), we **train only the new output layers**.

Thus, the model **preserves all its language understanding** but **adapts** to predicting emotions!

## üõ°Ô∏è Why Fine-Tune BERT?

- BERT already **knows language structure and meaning**.
- Fine-tuning is **faster** and requires **less data** compared to training a model from scratch.
- Fine-tuned BERT models are **state-of-the-art** for many classification tasks ‚Äî including **sentiment and emotion detection**.
